=== Installing {xpack}

By default, when you install {es}, {kib}, and Logstash, {xpack} is installed. 

IS this an "OR" or an "AND" statment regarding the "default"? i.e. does it mean :


`if you installed (ES && KIB && LS) => xpack is installed`

or does it mean:

`if ES || (KIB && LS) => xpack is installed`

or does it mean:

`if (ES || KIB) && LS => xpack is installed`

For more information, see:

* {ref}/install-elasticsearch.html[Installing {es}]
* {kibana-ref}/install.html[Installing {kib}]
* {logstash-ref}/installing-logstash.html[Installing Logstash]
